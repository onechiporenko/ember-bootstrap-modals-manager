`ember-bootstrap-modals-manager` is an Ember-addon that provides a simple mechanism for interaction with user using modals. This addon is based on modals from `ember-bootstrap`.

**Restriction** from the [Bootstrap#modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/modal/):

> Bootstrap only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals arenâ€™t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.

You can check how this addon works on [demo-page](https://onechiporenko.github.io/ember-bootstrap-modals-manager/demo).
